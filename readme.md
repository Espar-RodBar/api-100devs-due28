# Test with three Apis

Class 26-27 from 100Devs fantabulous Bootcamp

## Apis used:

In this exercise i used these three apis separately:

### https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/random

Generates a random emoji.

### https://clientes.api.greenborn.com.ar/public-random-word?c=1

Generates a random spanish word

### https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/

Generates a random Deck, and later draw a card from that deck

### Bonus:

I also used the localStorage from the browser, to save the deck from the third api.
